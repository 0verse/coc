# The Co/C Programming Language
Co/C is a systemic approach to the programming language. The Co/C syntax looks somewhat different but it is basically converted to, and fully compatible with C. Therefore, one can code valid C program if one wishes so, while mixing it with additional syntax. Needless to say, Co/C is not a replacement of C.

## Build
```
make
```

## Usage
```
./cocc runit examples/hello.co
```

## Example
```rust
    main()
{
    println("hello world!");
}
```
